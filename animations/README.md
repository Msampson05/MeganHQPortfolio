Place your Lottie JSON files in this folder.

Hero setup uses three files (drop your JSON with these names):
- hero-sparkles.json — small ambient sparkles behind the hero heading.
- hero-underline.json — a gentle underline flourish under the brand line.
- hero-flourish.json — a soft decorative flourish below the heading.

Performance tips:
- Prefer SVG renderer, keep under ~150KB if possible.
- Compress JSON (minify) and avoid heavy gradients or image assets.

Accessibility:
- Decorative only; containers are aria-hidden in the markup.
